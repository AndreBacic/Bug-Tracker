## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 User Needs
The users of this software need:
- To access the app through a web browser on a computer or mobile device.
- Their data saved securely for later use.
- Their accounts protected by a password and unique email address.
- To be able to edit or delete the data they add as they choose.
- A running list of projects and tasks they have marked as due within several days.
- To be able to organize their tasks into hierarchies. These hierarchies must not allow loops, but will be tree-like data structures.
- To mark each task as a specific priority, status, monetary expense, and due date.
- Diagrams displaying the analysis of individual projects and of all projects owned by a user. These analysis diagrams must generated by the software and show information regarding the total expense of a project, the percent of a project's tasks completed, and other statistics.
- A demo login mode for users to use the software without having to create an account.
- All links and buttons to be consistently and descriptively named.

### 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
This document assumes that the underlying technologies used to implement the software will function as expected, and that the developer(s) of the software will use reliable technologies that do not limit the software to a specific platform.

The software will be dependent of the frameworks, libraries, and programming languages used to implement the software.


## 3. System Features and Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

### 3.2 External Interface Requirements
- The front end (user interface) will be accessible through web browsers, and will interact with standard browser APIs.
- Administration of the back end (server and database) will be accessible through means provided by the hosting provider.
- The software will interface with server and client hardware through the underlying technologies used to implement the software.

### 3.3 System Features

### 3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements
- As a web app, this software must be compatible with all modern browsers with >1.25% market share. 
- The chosen color scheme must use contrasting colors such that the interface passes the devtools lighthouse audit.
- All buttons and links must be larger than or equal to 400px^2 (ex. 20px x 20px), regardless of screen size.
- Although application performance depends primarily on the user's device and hosting service, all algorithms used in the software must be implemented with best scalability.
